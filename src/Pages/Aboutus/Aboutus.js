        For each project we establish relationships with partners who we know will
        help us create added value for your project. As well as bringing together
        the public and private sectors, we make sector-overarching links to gather
        knowledge and to learn from each other. The way we undertake projects is
        based on permanently applying values that reinforce each other: socio-cultural
        value, experiental value, building-technical value and economical value.
        This way of working allows us to raise your project to a higher level.
